      <h1 className="article-title">Is Ego a Human Thing or Do Animals Have It Too?</h1>
      <p className="date">April 12, 2024</p>

      <p>I’ve asked myself this question more often than I realize.</p>

      <p>What is ego?<br />
      Is it the sudden sharp jealousy I feel when my boyfriend laughs with another girl?<br />
      Is it the awkward lump in my throat that stops me from saying “sorry” even when I know I should?<br />
      Is it the pride that makes me want to seem unbothered, even when I’m breaking inside?<br />
      Or… is it something more mysterious?<br />
      Maybe even something useful?</p>

      <p>And then, just as quickly as the thought arrives, it fades — tucked away in a corner of my mind, only to resurface when I least expect it.</p>

      <p>Like when I look into the eyes of my dog.</p>

      <p>When she’s done something wrong and slinks into a corner, avoiding my gaze, her eyes silently pleading, “Are you mad at me?”<br />
      Or when she barks at another dog, not out of fear, but out of some instinct to dominate — to declare “I’m here, I matter!”<br />
      Or when she nudges my hand for attention the moment I speak kindly to another animal.</p>

      <p>It makes me wonder:<br />
      Is this ego too? Or am I just projecting my human mess onto her innocent little soul?</p>

      <p>But if ego is about identity — about the feeling of “I,” of “me,” of being someone who wants, needs, fears, protects — then maybe animals have it too.</p>

      <p>Just in a different language.</p>

      <p>We define ego in lofty, abstract terms. But maybe it’s more primal than that. Maybe ego is just the self’s way of saying, “I’m here. I exist. Please see me.”</p>

      <h2>The Story: The Lion and the Wounded Pup</h2>

      <p>In the vast expanse of a golden savannah lived a lion, fierce and feared, his mane like fire and his roar thunder in the wind. He was strong, proud, and solitary. He knew his worth. He ruled his land.</p>

      <p>One evening, while resting beneath an acacia tree, he saw a limping pup — small, injured, and trembling — wandering into his territory. The lion stood, his pride flaring. No creature entered his domain without fear. He prepared to roar, to send the intruder fleeing.</p>

      <p>But the pup did not run.</p>

      <p>Instead, it sat. Quietly. Looking up at the lion with wide, trusting eyes. Not defiance. Not fear. Just... presence.</p>

      <p>Something in the lion stirred. He didn’t roar. He didn’t attack.</p>

      <p>Instead, he sat too.</p>

      <p>The pup didn’t ask for anything. Didn’t try to prove anything. It simply was — hurt, but honest. Small, but unashamed. The lion, watching, realized something he had never allowed himself to admit:</p>

      <p>All his roaring, all his solitude, all his pride — was it strength, or was it armor?</p>

      <p>That night, he lay down beside the pup. And for the first time in years, he didn’t sleep alone.</p>

      <p>Days passed. The pup healed. And when it finally left, the lion felt no urge to roar.</p>

      <p>He had found strength in stillness. And he understood:<br />
      True power wasn’t in how loudly he claimed his land,<br />
      But in how gently he could hold space for another.</p>

      <h2>The Reflection</h2>

      <p>So maybe the question isn’t “Do animals have ego?”<br />
      Maybe the question is: What is ego, really?</p>

      <p>Your dog who shows guilt, your cat who ignores you for hours, the bird that puffs its chest — maybe they all feel something like ego. But not in the complicated, self-destructive way we sometimes do.</p>

      <p>Theirs is simpler. Pure. Survival mixed with affection. Protection mixed with presence.</p>

      <p>And us?<br />
      We’ve just layered it with stories, shame, society, and insecurity.</p>

      <p>Maybe ego isn’t the enemy. Maybe it’s a call to be seen, to be held, to be loved — just like that lion and that pup.</p>

      <p>Maybe, just maybe, ego is a bridge between who we are and who we long to be.</p>
