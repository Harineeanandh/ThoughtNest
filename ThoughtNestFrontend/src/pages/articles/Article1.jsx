      <h1 className="article-title">Guilty eating meat?</h1>
      <p className="date">April 8, 2024</p>

      <p>Ever since I was little, I’ve felt this inexplicable tenderness for animals. I wasn’t taught it. It just… existed inside me. Like it was coded in my DNA. Whether it was a bird on a power line, a stray limping by, or a video of a calf being reunited with its mother, something in me stirred, a deep, soul-wrenching compassion that refused to stay quiet.</p>

      <p>And yet, here I am, someone who still finds it nearly impossible to resist the taste of meat.</p>

      <p>Every time I sit down to eat mutton, I feel a gnawing guilt begin to claw at my insides. I think of the goat. I think of the dog who sleeps curled up beside me. I look at my cat, blinking slowly, stretching her paw toward my hand with sleepy trust, and I ask myself the same impossible question again:</p>

      <p><em>How is the goat whose flesh I just consumed any different from the dog and cat whose life I treasure?</em></p>
      
      <img src="/assets/dog and cat.png" className="image-dog-cat" alt="" />
      
      <p>No answer ever satisfies me. Not “survival instinct.” Not “the food chain.” Not “it’s cultural.” Each reason feels like a brittle mask cracking under the weight of truth. I see the eyes of a creature once alive. I imagine its fear, its longing for comfort, its silent scream when it was taken from the world.</p>

      <p>And I wonder. Why is that pain any less sacred than ours?</p>

      <p>The guilt isn’t just emotional. It feels moral. Like a betrayal. Like I’m split in two, one part yearning to live gently, another stuck in patterns I’m afraid to change.</p>

      <p>So I searched for peace. And peace came to me in the form of a story.</p>

      <h2>The Story: The Bridge Between Me and Them</h2>
      <img src="/assets/mountain village.jpg" alt="Story illustration" className="image-mountain" />

      <p>A young woman once lived in a mountain village where the winters were harsh and the people hardened by need. Her family raised animals for food — it was how they survived. But she was unlike the others. She spoke to the animals. She gave them names. When she fed them, she did it with tenderness.</p>

      <p>One winter, when food grew scarce, the family prepared to slaughter their last goat. The girl cried and begged them to spare him. But hunger roared louder than her protests. That night, they ate the goat.</p>

      <p>She didn’t sleep. She crept into the snow, found the goat’s shed, and knelt in the silence.</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered. “I didn’t fight harder for you.”</p>

      <p>Then something curious happened. A strange warmth enveloped her, though the air was ice.</p>

      <p>A voice, soft, but not human, spoke in her chest.</p>

      <p>“You saw me,” it said. “That’s all I ever wanted.”</p>

      <p>She wept.</p>

      <p>From that day, she didn’t stop eating meat completely. But every time she did, she paused. She remembered a name. A face. She lit a candle. She planted a flower.</p>

      <p>And slowly, something shifted. She began to eat less meat, not out of guilt, but out of reverence. When she did eat it, it was mindfully, never wastefully. And as the years passed, she helped the village grow food in new ways. She built a sanctuary. She became known as the bridge, between those who ate and those who were eaten.</p>

      <p>She lived her life honoring both.</p>

      <h2>The Lesson</h2>

      <p>Maybe the answer isn’t to flip a switch, go vegan overnight, and punish yourself every time you fail. Maybe the answer is gentler, like that girl in the story.</p>

      <p>Start by remembering. By seeing.</p>

      <p>See the animals whose lives are lost.</p>

      <p>See your heart and how deeply it loves.</p>

      <p>Then slowly, choose differently when you can. Choose plant-based once a week. Choose to cook with care. Choose to talk about it, not with shame, but with honesty.</p>

      <p>And when you do eat meat, choose reverence over remorse. Pause. Remember. Be the bridge.</p>

      <p>That guilt you feel? It’s a sign your soul is alive.</p>

      <p>Now let it lead you to a life where your choices and your compassion no longer feel at war but in harmony.</p>
