      <h1 className="article-title">The Secret Language of Nightmares: What They Teach Us, What They Warn Us</h1>
      <p className="date">April 8, 2024</p>

      <p>I used to think nightmares were curses.</p>

      <p>That jolting feeling — gasping awake, drenched in sweat, heart racing as if I truly had been running from something — left me shaken for days.</p>

      <p>But the more I’ve lived, the more I’ve begun to ask a different question:</p>

      <p>What if nightmares aren’t there to torment us?<br />
      What if they’re messengers — dressed in shadows, yes — but messengers of light nonetheless?</p>

      <h2>The Repeating Signs</h2>

      <p>I’ve had these dreams, over and over again:</p>

      <p>My family and I trying to survive a tsunami, the ocean swallowing everything in sight.</p>

      <p>Being chased by snakes through narrow alleyways.</p>

      <p>Falling into an endless pit of black tar with only my mother’s hand in mine.</p>

      <p>Fleeing from an explosion, breathless, only to realize I forgot to grab my brother’s hand.</p>

      <p>I’d wake up horrified, haunted.</p>

      <p>But the eeriest part?<br />
      Something similar would often happen in real life.<br />
      Not a literal tsunami or explosion — but emotional breakdowns, near-death scares, intense fights, or mental crises… always within days.</p>

      <p>Once, just days before my brother went through a severe mental breakdown, I had a nightmare where I watched him die.<br />
      And I couldn’t shake the thought:<br />
      Could it be that my subconscious already knew something was about to happen?<br />
      Could my love for him be so deep, that my soul cried out through symbols before my conscious mind could catch up?</p>

      <p>This began my journey into the mysterious world of dreams.</p>

      <h2>Dreams Speak in Symbols, Not Words</h2>

      <p>Our conscious mind uses language.<br />
      Our subconscious — the deeper, ancient part of us — uses symbols, patterns, metaphors.</p>

      <p>When you dream of drowning, it may not be about water.<br />
      It may be about feeling overwhelmed in life.</p>

      <p>When you dream of snakes, it could mean danger, transformation, or repressed fear.<br />
      Falling into a tar-black ocean?<br />
      That might be your soul showing you grief, helplessness, or the fear of losing someone.</p>

      <p>And these aren’t just fantasies. These are emotional truths, cloaked in surreal images.</p>

      <p>Nightmares are just dreams that scream, “Please look! Please feel! Please heal!”</p>

      <h2>The Story: The Girl Who Listened to Her Dreams</h2>

      <p>There was once a girl named Ira, who lived in a quiet town nestled beside a misty forest.</p>

      <p>For months, Ira had been haunted by the same nightmare:<br />
      She would be standing on a hill, watching the village burn, unable to move. Always, she saw one thing clearly — her little sister standing in the fire, smiling, as if unaware she was being consumed.</p>

      <p>Terrified, Ira tried everything to stop the dreams. Herbal teas. Incense. Even sleeping with the lights on.</p>

      <p>But the dreams didn’t stop — until one day, she stopped trying to fight them.</p>

      <p>Instead, she decided to listen.</p>

      <p>She sat quietly one evening and painted what she saw: the hill, the fire, the smile. And as she painted, something inside her clicked.</p>

      <p>She realized she’d been ignoring something for weeks: her sister had grown distant. Sad. Lost in thought. She never smiled like she used to. And Ira, caught up in her own routine, hadn’t noticed.</p>

      <p>That night, Ira went to her sister’s room and simply held her hand.</p>

      <p>Her sister broke down.</p>

      <p>She had been hiding thoughts of ending her life, unable to speak to anyone. But something about Ira's presence that night — her timing, her quiet love — made her feel safe again.</p>

      <p>In the days that followed, her sister began healing. The dreams stopped.<br />
      And Ira never forgot:</p>

      <p>Nightmares don’t come to harm us.<br />
      They come to help us remember what matters before it’s too late.</p>

      <h2>What They Really Are</h2>

      <p>Nightmares are not omens.<br />
      They are mirrors.</p>

      <p>They reflect:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The anxiety we bury under busyness</li>
        <li>The grief we’ve numbed</li>
        <li>The instincts we ignore</li>
        <li>The people we love but haven’t checked in on</li>
        <li>The deep truths we know… but are too afraid to face in daylight</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So when a nightmare shakes you — listen.<br />
      It could be your soul’s way of keeping you awake… even while you sleep.</p>

      <h2>The Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>So now I ask:</p>

      <p>Are nightmares bad?<br />
      Or are they sacred whispers — intense, yes, uncomfortable, sure — but full of wisdom and warning?</p>

      <p>Could it be that our dreams — especially the ones that hurt — are simply the language of our truest self, trying to keep us whole?</p>

      <p>And if we started treating them not with fear, but with reverence…</p>

      <p>Maybe we’d stop running from the snakes and tsunamis and instead…<br />
      understand what they came to show us.</p>
