/**
 * This is a basic integration test class for the Spring Boot application context.
 *
 * The primary purpose of this test is to ensure that the entire Spring application
 * context can be loaded successfully without any errors. This serves as a basic
 * sanity check during the build or test phase.
 *
 * An application context failure here typically indicates that there are serious
 * misconfigurations in the application setup (e.g., missing beans, circular dependencies,
 * incorrect application properties, etc.).
 *
 * The @SpringBootTest annotation triggers the full application context to load
 * including all beans, configurations, and properties, making it an ideal test
 * to catch early misconfiguration issues.
